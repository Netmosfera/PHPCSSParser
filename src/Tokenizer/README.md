# Reference CSS Tokenizer

No muss no fuss CSS tokenizer that runs relatively fast and is easy to maintain.

This module is independent from the rest of the library; it can be replaced with
a module that does the same job.

## Current state

While it works and it is fully tested, this library needs some major refactoring
in many of its components. Check the `@TODO` annotations for additional details.
